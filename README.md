# PyTorch FashionMNIST CNN Mini Project

This is a simple mini project demonstrating how to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch on the FashionMNIST dataset for image classification.

## Overview
- **Dataset**: FashionMNIST (28x28 grayscale images of clothing items, 10 classes).
- **Model**: A basic CNN with convolutional layers, max pooling, and fully connected layers.
- **Training**: 5 epochs, Adam optimizer, cross-entropy loss.
- **Evaluation**: Test accuracy ~92%, confusion matrix, classification report.
- **Outputs**: Training metrics CSV, class distribution CSV, visualizations (confusion matrix heatmap).

## Files
- `fashionmnist_cnn.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with the full code.
- `training_metrics.csv`: Generated CSV with epoch-wise training loss.
- `class_distribution.csv`: Generated CSV with class counts in the training data.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies for running the notebook.
